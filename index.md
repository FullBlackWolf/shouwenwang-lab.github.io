# Welcome to the Wang Lab!

<!-- We are a group of inter-disciplinary scientists that explore the wonder of biology by integrating single-cell genomics and machine learning. We use machine learning to refer to statistical modeling approaches inspired from either statistical physics, computer science, or applied mathematics! -->

 We are dedicated to developing quantitative analysis and modeling methods for single-cell lineage tracing data, and integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements to further reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying biological phenomena at different scales, such as cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis. We closely collaborate with other groups, integrate cutting-edge experimental designs and data collection for lineage tracing, and draw inspiration from fields such as statistical physics, computer science, and applied mathematics for data analysis. Our lab pursue a research path that crosses academic disciplines and combines experimental and computational approaches.
