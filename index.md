# Welcome to the Wang Lab!


 We are dedicated to developing quantitative analysis and modeling methods for single-cell lineage tracing data, and integrating transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements to further understand biological phenomena at different scales, such as cell differentiation and tissue homeostasis. 
 
 We closely collaborate with other groups, integrate cutting-edge experimental designs and data collection for lineage tracing, and draw inspiration from fields such as statistical physics, computer science, and applied mathematics for data analysis.
